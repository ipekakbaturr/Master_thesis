This thesis focuses on the discretization and implementation of the Poisson and a gyrokinetic turbu- lence model with adiabatic electrons within the Struphy framework. Struphy is an open source Python package to solve plasma physics PDEs. Models are discretized and implemented with the finite ele- ment exterior calculus (FEEC) and particle-in-cell (PIC) methods. Initially, we discretize the Poisson equation using splines demonstrating high-order accuracy and computational efficiency. The core of the thesis involves the gyrokinetic model, which describes the behavior of charged particles in a mag- netized plasma. We derive the equations of motion and ensure that the discretized system respects the fundamental symmetries and semi-discrete energy conservation. Furthermore, we validate the gy- rokinetic model through a Landau damping test, confirming its capability to accurately capture essential plasma phenomena. The results highlight the effectiveness of the Hamiltonian discretization approach and the practical applicability of the implemented numerical methods in plasma physics.
